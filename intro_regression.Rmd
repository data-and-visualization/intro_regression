details = read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wyseguy7/intro_regression/master/data/airbnb_details.csv")

df <- basic %>% inner_join(details, by='id') %>% select(price, cleaning_fee, property_type, room_type, number_of_reviews, review_scores_rating) %>%  extract(cleaning_fee, "cleaning_fee") %>%
  mutate(cleaning_fee = as.numeric(cleaning_fee)) %>%
  mutate(cleaning_fee = case_when(is.na(cleaning_fee)~ 0,
                                  TRUE ~ cleaning_fee))%>%
  mutate(price_3_nights= cleaning_fee+3*price) %>%
  filter(property_type %in% c('House', 'Apartment','Guest suite')) %>%
  filter(price < 5000) # remove some outliers
df
```
## Exercise 1
Take a look at the data. Explore it if you like, and recode the character columns as factors so we can use them in our regression. 
```{r recoding}

df <- df %>% mutate(
  room_type=as.factor(room_type),
  property_type=as.factor(property_type),
)
head(df)
```



## Exercise 2

Using the `df` object created above, run a regression that predicts `price_3_nights` using `room_type`, `property_type` and `number_of_reviews`. 

Look at the output. Which of the variables are significant? Which are not? How did the `room_type` variable get used, and as which category was used as the baseline? 

Note: when using categorical variables, the category that gets used as a baseline will always be the first level in the factor. You can adjust this by modifying the column with the with the `relevel` function
```{r regression}


# Answers: 
model = lm(price_3_nights ~ room_type + property_type  + number_of_reviews, data=df)
broom::tidy(model) %>% kable(format="markdown", digits=3) 
```

## Exercise 3
Extract the residuals from the model as `res`, and calculate the $R^2$ value. Recall for residuals $e_i$, $R^2 =  1-\frac{\sum e_i^2}{nVar[Y]} = 1-\frac{\sum e_i^2}{\sum(y_i-\bar{y})^2}$ is 1 minus the sum of the squared residuals divided by the variance of $Y$ times $n$

```{r residuals}

res = residuals(model)
r2 = 1-sum(res**2)/var(df$price_3_nights)/length(res)
r2
```

## Exercise 4
Examine the plots below, and determine whether our model meets the core assumptions of
- Linearity
- Constant Variance
- Normality
- Independence
```{r assumptions_check}
fitted = model$fitted.values
ggplot(mapping = aes(x=fitted,y=res)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_hline(yintercept=0,color="red") +
  labs(title="Model Residuals vs. Fitted Values", 
       x="Fitted Values", y="Residuals")

ggplot(mapping = aes(x=res)) + geom_histogram(bins=100) + 
  labs(title="Histogram of Model Residuals", 
       x="Residuals", y="Count")

ggplot(mapping = aes(sample=res)) + 
  stat_qq() + stat_qq_line() +  
  labs(title="QQ-Plot of Residuals")



```

## Exercise 5
Lets try predicting `log(price_3_nights)` instead, to see if this helps us resolve some of the issues we were having with our assumptions. 

```{r assumptions_check}
m2 <- lm(log(price) ~ room_type + number_of_reviews + cleaning_fee, data=df)
res = m2$residuals
fitted = m2$fitted.values
ggplot(mapping = aes(x=fitted,y=res)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_hline(yintercept=0,color="red") +
  labs(title="Model Residuals vs. Fitted Values", 
       x="Fitted Values", y="Residuals")

ggplot(mapping = aes(x=res)) + geom_histogram(bins=100) + 
  labs(title="Histogram of Model Residuals", 
       x="Residuals", y="Count")

ggplot(mapping = aes(sample=res)) + 
  stat_qq() + stat_qq_line() +  
  labs(title="QQ-Plot of Residuals")



```


#### Advanced applications
```{r advanced}

## fit interaction terms
## for room_type x cleaning_fee and room_type x number_of_reviews
model = lm(price ~ room_type + number_of_reviews+cleaning_fee + room_type*(number_of_reviews + cleaning_fee), data=df)

## don't fit an intercept in the model  
model = lm(price ~ room_type + number_of_reviews+cleaning_fee - 1, data=df)


## extract the X matrix
## note that the QR algorithm is used to compute the inverse of (X^TX), so results aren't completely precise
X = qr.X(model$qr)

## coefficients of the model  
model$coefficients 

## fitting a logistic model 
df_sub <- df %>% filter(room_type %in% c('Entire room', 'Shared room'))
logistic_model = glm(room_type ~ price + number_of_reviews, data=df_sub, family=binomial)

## fitting a Poisson model
pois_model = glm(number_of_reviews ~ price + room_type, data=df, family=poisson)

library(nnet)
# fitting a multinomial model
multinom_model = multinom(room_type ~ price + number_of_reviews, data=df)


#### statistical tests ########

## Nested F-test to compare significance of group of predictors
full = lm(price ~ room_type + number_of_reviews+cleaning_fee + room_type*(number_of_reviews + cleaning_fee), data=df)
reduced = lm(price ~ room_type + number_of_reviews+cleaning_fee, data=df)
anova(reduced, full)


## Drop in deviance test for logistic/multinomial regression
full = lm(property_type ~ room_type + number_of_reviews+cleaning_fee + room_type*(number_of_reviews + cleaning_fee), data=df)
reduced = lm(property_type ~ room_type + number_of_reviews+cleaning_fee, data=df)

anova(reduced, full, test='Chisq')

## Attaching variable-level diagnostics
# `augment` will calculate and return residuals, fitted values, leverage
# cooks distance, etc
df_aug = broom::augment(model)
